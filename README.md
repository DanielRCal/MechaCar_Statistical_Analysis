##Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The variables/ coefficients which provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value in the datatset include; vehicle_wieght, AWD, and spoiler_angle.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the value of p is less than zero.

This linear model can be used to  predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes with effectiveness of roughly 71.4%.

## Summary Statistics on Suspention Coils
Current manufacturing data indicates that the total design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils are not being met in total.  Individual Lots 1 and 2 meet design specifications. However, Lot 3 exceeds the variance limitations of design specification.
