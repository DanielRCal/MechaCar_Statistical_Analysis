## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The variables/ coefficients which provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value in the datatset include; vehicle_wieght, AWD, and spoiler_angle.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the value of p is less than zero.

This linear model can be used to  predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes with effectiveness of roughly 71.4%.

## Summary Statistics on Suspention Coils
Current manufacturing data indicates that the total design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils are not being met in total.  Individual Lots 1 and 2 meet design specifications. However, Lot 3 exceeds the variance limitations of design specification.

## MechaCar Vs Competition
When comparing MechaCar against its competitors using a test such as ANOVA might provide more clarifying results. MechaCar should consider gathering data that is more relavant to consumers.  They might consider data gathered from cost, fuel efficiency, safety ratings, or maintenance cost.  We would test the similarities or differences in the mean of multiples samples. Our null hypothesis might consider MechaCar having equal or similar performance among the various categories. The alternative hypothesis might suggest that there are immense differences in the varying categories. If the null is rejected in favor of the alternative then the MechaCar mean would need to be evaluated and compared against that of the competition.  An average below would mean that the competition is faring better, while an average above would mean the opposite.
