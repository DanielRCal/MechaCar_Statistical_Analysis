##Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The variables/ coefficients which provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value in the datatset include; vehicle_wieght, AWD, and spoiler_angle.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the value of p is less than zero.

This linear model can be used to  predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes with effectiveness of roughly 71.4%.
